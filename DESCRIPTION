Description: Functions to perform stepwise split regularized regression. The approach first 
             uses a stepwise algorithm to split the variables into the models with a goodness
             of fit criterion, and then regularization is applied to each model. The weights 
             of the models in the ensemble are determined based on a criterion selected by 
             the user.
